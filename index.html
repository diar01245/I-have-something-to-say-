    <h1>💌 A Letter For You</h1>
    <p>
        Hi… okay… deep breath, (Jeni, calm down, calm down).
        I’m literally so nervous writing this, my hands are shaking, but… here goes nothing—and maybe everything.
        <br>
        I don’t even know when you’ll read this, or if you’ll actually read it, and that honestly scares me a lot. I know I said “no love, no romance,” and I meant it, but somehow you just… broke that rule without even trying. I don’t know when it happened or how, but I’ve started to miss you… like I miss my morning coffee. My day just feels incomplete without you in it.
        <br>
        And yeah, I know I kept asking about you and Laureen—because I needed to know if it was even safe for me to open my stupid heart like this.
        <br>
        So… okay… here it is:
        You’ve somehow become my lucky clover 🍀.
        My days feel lighter and kind of… better because of you. Your songs feel like warm hugs when I need them. And you… you’ve made this “logical girl” break every bit of her logic and it’s honestly annoying and wonderful at the same time.
        <br>
        My heart literally whispers your melody in its quiet moments.
        I smile when I think about you, and it just… feels right.
        <br>
        And trust me, I tried SO hard to compress all of this, because in my head you’re like this unapproachable star I could never touch. But my heart is stubborn and refuses to shut up.
        <br>
        So… let me just confess it before I chicken out again:
        I like you—not just as a friend.<br>
        I like you the way I like the stars in the morning.<br>
        I like you the way I like my coffee.<br>
        I like you like the saying goes: “The moon is beautiful, isn’t it?”<br>
        I like you the way my orbit keeps getting pulled toward yours… like this gravity I can’t explain.
        <br>
        <b><u><i>So… um… can I hit on you?</i></u></b>
        <br>
        <ul style="display:inline-block; text-align:left;">
            <li>If it’s a yes, just send me a 🦋.</li>
            <li>If it’s a no, or if your heart already belongs to someone else, then… just send anything except that.</li>
        </ul>

        And… um… regardless of what you send—yes or no—  
        please click the photo and poem buttons.  
        They’re gifts from me, and they still mean something either way.
    </p>

    <h1>🌹 A Poem For You</h1>
    <h2> My morning star</h2>
    <div class="content-box" style="text-align:center; font-size:1.8rem;">
        <p>
           

If you say ,you hide in shadows <br>
I will search you in the dark <br>
Be the light , which holds your willow<br>
And , be silent surrender to your park <br><br>

If you say , you are a troubled soul <br>
I will protect your life thread in my hand <br>
Be the warmth , which keeps the heat <br>
And , be the cave when you need a hiding place <br><br>

If you say , you are dangerous zone <br>
I will take a risk with blindfold on <br>
Be the whisper , which will cheer you up<br>
And , be the arms which pulls you in <br><br>

If you say , you are a forbidden fruit <br>
I will take a bite , throwing aftermaths <br>
Be the embrace, which is standby for you <br>
And , be the tune when silence is your song <br><br>
